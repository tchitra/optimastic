1. Add in an interface for generic stochastic optimizers 
 * Need to figure out the  minimal, least common denominator of state within such optimizers

2. Structure the program a bit better

3. Add in threading support, maybe something like Hogwild?

4. Python interface, perhaps a restricted Python function interface in Cython?

5. Citations for the different algorithms used

6. Documentation?
